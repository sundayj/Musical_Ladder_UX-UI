A note on the file structure:
While this project is written in html for a website, it is meant to be viewed as an app built using an MVC model.
With that being said, the index.html is meant to be used as the main template, with the iframe to be seen as the view and the individual _name.html files in their respective folders as meant to be individual models for the view space.
I structured it this way in order to make it easier to break everything apart for use in an app building framework.
